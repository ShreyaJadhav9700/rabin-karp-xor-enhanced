# Rabin-Karp XOR-Enhanced Pattern Matching

This project demonstrates how XOR Filters can optimize the Rabin-Karp algorithm by reducing false positives and improving performance.

## Features
- Implements rolling hash
- Lightweight XOR filter for fast filtering
- Suitable for large datasets and fast string matching

## Run the Code
```bash
python demo.py
